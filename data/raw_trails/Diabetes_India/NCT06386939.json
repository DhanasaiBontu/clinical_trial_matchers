Asian Indians develop T2DM at a younger age, and progresses faster than in other ethnic groups. As a result, many diabetes complications are more prevalent and in more advanced stages in Asian countries than in other regions. Asian Indians have one of the highest incidence rates of pre-diabetes and T2DM among all major ethnic groups, and the conversion from pre-diabetes to T2DM occurs more rapidly in this population. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research- India diabetes study (57 117 individuals), the prevalence of prediabetes in all 15 states was 7·3%.\n\nThe tendency of Asian Indian to develop T2DM is enhanced by greater insulin resistance, dysglycemia, subclinical inflammation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\nAcanthosis nigricans (AN) describes clinically a darkly pigmented thickening skin, which produces epidermal and dermal hyperplasia with orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis of the stratum spinosum with basal layer hyperpigmentation, in the absence of actual acanthosis and melanocytosis on histologic examination. It is a reactive cutaneous change closely associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia; endocrinopathy; or malignancy, in particular gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. The prevalence varies, and ethnicity seems an independent factor. Evidence indicates that AN is a useful clinical marker to identify patients susceptible to insulin resistance, the MetS, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).\n\nThis Prospective observational study will be of 12-18 months' duration where 150 T2DM patients from urban areas of Delhi will be randomly screened. The population will be representative of different socio-economic strata of the society. Clinical and dietary profiles, blood pressure and phenotypic markers (acanthosis nigricans, buffalo hump, skin tags: xanthelasma, double chin, arcus, hirsutism and tendon xanthoma), diabetic retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), neuropathy, nephropathy HTN, CHF, CT Coronary Angiography, CAD, Arrhythmias, Coronary Calcification, Cerebrovascular Disease, peripheral vascular disease, micro albumin urea, fibro scan and hand grip (average of three values) JAMAR measurement will be assessed."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"With Acanthosis Nigricans","description":"T2DM with Acanthosis Nigricans"},{"label":"Without Acanthosis Nigricans","description":"T2DM Without Acanthosis Nigricans"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Moderate to Severe Acanthosis Nigricans increases diabetes complications","timeFrame":"18 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
