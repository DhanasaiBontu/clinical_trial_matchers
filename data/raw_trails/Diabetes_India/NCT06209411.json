The investigators propose a cluster randomized clinical trial to determine whether community health worker-administered, home-based testing increases uptake of postpartum diabetes screening in the urban slums of Pune, India. The proposed study will provide an acceptable and scalable model that can be used to improve postpartum diabetes screening in other low-income settings, thereby improving early detection of diabetes in women and preventing morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population.","detailedDescription":"The purpose of the project is to determine the effectiveness of a community health worker (CHW)-delivered home based oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (home testing arm) versus referral for clinic-based screening (referral arm) and evaluate the implementation of the CHW-delivered programs.\n\nDesign and Project Type: This hybrid type II effectiveness- implementation cluster randomized trial aims to evaluate if CHWs can improve postpartum type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) screening in the urban slums of Pune, India. Slum communities will be randomized in equal number to one of two study arms. Participants in both arms will receive CHW-delivered OGTT during pregnancy to screen for GDM. For women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the investigators will evaluate two strategies to improve T2DM screening in the first year postpartum: CHW-delivered home based OGTT (home testing arm) versus referral for clinic-based screening (referral arm).\n\nDescription of Intervention: The intervention is postpartum screening for T2DM which involves oral intake of a glucose load and subsequent measurement of fasting and postprandial point of care blood glucose measurement."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2","Gestational Diabetes"],"keywords":["Community Health Workers","Type 2 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Cluster Randomized Trial","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Referral Arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"CHW will contact participants with GDM from communities in the referral arm beginning at 6 weeks postpartum to arrange a convenient time for a home visit within the first postpartum year.
