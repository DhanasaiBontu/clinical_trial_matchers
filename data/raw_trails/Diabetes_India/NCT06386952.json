Asian Indians develop T2DM at a younger age, and progresses faster than in other ethnic groups. As a result, many diabetes complications are more prevalent and in more advanced stages in Asian countries than in other regions. Asian Indians have one of the highest incidence rates of pre-diabetes and T2DM among all major ethnic groups, and the conversion from pre-diabetes to T2DM occurs more rapidly in this population. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research- India diabetes study (57 117 individuals), the prevalence of prediabetes in all 15 states was 7·3%.\n\nThe tendency of Asian Indian to develop T2DM is enhanced by greater insulin resistance, dysglycemia, subclinical inflammation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\n\"Buffalo hump,\" or a dorso cervical fat pad, is a term that refers to a collection of excess fat behind the neck that causes the shoulders to develop a hump-like shape. It can be caused by a variety of underlying conditions or medications.\n\nA buffalo hump is most commonly a result of Cushing syndrome, a disorder of excess cortisol, a naturally occurring hormone that is involved in a variety of bodily processes, such as metabolism. High levels of the hormone cortisol can lead to increased fat synthesis. With Cushing syndrome, the fat produced often deposits in the neck, known as lipodystrophy. This produces the characteristic buffalo hump. Cushing syndrome may be caused by an adrenal tumor, lung tumor, or glucocorticoid medications. If Cushing syndrome is caused by a pituitary tumor, it is known as Cushing disease.\n\nThis Prospective observational study will be of 12 months' duration where 100 T2DM patients from urban areas of Delhi will be randomly screened. The population will be representative of different socio-economic strata of the society. Clinical and dietary profiles, blood pressure and phenotypic markers (acanthosis nigricans, buffalo hump, skin tags: xanthelasma, double chin, arcus, hirsutism and tendon xanthoma), diabetic retinopathy, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), neuropathy, nephropathy HTN, CHF, CT Coronary Angiography, CAD, Arrhythmias, Coronary Calcification, Cerebrovascular Disease, peripheral vascular disease, micro albumin urea, fibro scan and hand grip (average of three values) JAMAR measurement will be assessed.\n\nTo diagnose a buffalo hump and its underlying cause, a healthcare professional generally will review the individual's current medications and medical history, as well as conduct a physical examination."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With Complication"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"With Double Dorsal Cervical Fat","description":"T2DM with Double Dorsal Cervical Fat (Double Hump)"},{"label":"Without Double Dorsal Cervical Fat","description":"T2DM without Double Dorsal Cervical Fat (Double Hump)"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Double Hump increases diabetes complications","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
