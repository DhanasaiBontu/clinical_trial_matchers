Solutions are needed to reduce heat exposure in communities. Sunlight-reflecting cool roof coatings passively reduce indoor temperatures and energy use to protect home occupants from extreme heat. Occupants living in poor housing conditions globally - for example in informal settlements, slums, and low-socioeconomic households - are especially vulnerable to increased indoor heat exposure.\n\nHeat exposure can instigate and worsen numerous physical, mental and social health conditions. The worst adverse health effects are being experienced in communities least able to adapt to heat exposure. By reducing indoor temperatures, cool roof use can promote physical, mental and social wellbeing in occupants.\n\nThe long-term research goal is to identify viable passive housing adaptation technologies with proven health and environmental benefits to reduce the burden of heat stress in communities affected by heat globally. To meet this goal, the investigators will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial to establish the effects of cool roof use on health, indoor environment and economic outcomes in four urban climate hotspots: Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; Hermosillo, Mexico; Ahmedabad, India; and Niue, Oceania.","detailedDescription":"Increasing heat exposure from climate change is causing and exacerbating heat-related illnesses in millions worldwide - particularly in low resource settings. June 2024 was the 13th consecutive hottest month on record globally - shattering previous records. Heat exposure can instigate and worsen health conditions including cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine and respiratory disease, heat-related illnesses, pregnancy complications, and mental health conditions. Adaptation is essential for protecting people from increasing heat exposure. The built environment, especially our homes, are ideal for deploying interventions to reduce heat exposure and accelerate adaptation efforts. However, currently there is a lack of evidence on a global scale - generated through empirical studies - guiding the uptake of interventions to reduce heat stress in low resource settings.\n\nSunlight-reflecting cool roof coatings passively reduce indoor temperatures and lower energy use, offering protection to home occupants from extreme heat. The investigators aim to conduct a global multi-centre cluster-randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of cool-roof use on health, environmental and economic outcomes in four urban climate hotspots - Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso (sub-Saharan Africa), Ahmedabad, India (Asia), Niue (Oceania), and Hermosillo, Mexico (Latin America). The sites represent hotspots where people experience a triple burden from heat exposure, chronic health issues and vulnerable housing conditions (slums, informal settlements and low socioeconomic housing). They also exhibit diversity in climate profiles, housing typology, level of socioeconomic development, population density and rates of urbanisation.\n\nThe trial will quantify whether cool roofs are an effective passive home cooling intervention with beneficial health effects for vulnerable populations in four locations. Findings will inform global policy responses on scaling cool roof implementation to protect people from increasing heat exposure driven by climate change."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Resting Heart Rate","Blood Glucose Control","Depression","Heat-related Symptoms","Physician Diagnosed Heat-related Illnesses","Food Insecurity","Diet Quality","Health-related Quality of Life","Indoor Thermal Comfort","Coping Ability","Life Satisfaction","Healthcare Provider Utilization","Hospitalization","Systolic Blood Pressure","Diastolic Blood Pressure","Inner Ear Canal Temperature","Dehydration","Sleep Quality","Cognition","Productivity","Aggression","Indoor Air Temperature","Indoor Relative Humidity","Indoor Heat Index","Household Energy Expenditure"],"keywords":["Hot Temperature","Humidity","Housing","Heart rate","Cardiovascular","Depression","Mental health","Blood glucose","Diabetes","Cool roof","Heat Stress"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","maskingDescription":"Trial participants will be aware of the intervention to which they have been allocated, and the research fieldworkers will be aware of the intervention allocation.
