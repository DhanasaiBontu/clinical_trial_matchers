Patients in the treatment arms, who are unable to tolerate carvedilol due to hypotension episodes, will be offered ivabradine alone to allow achievement of targeted heart rate reduction. All patients will be evaluated at 0,6, and 12 months. The end points will be clinical events, cardiac function improvement, renal function, and mortality.","detailedDescription":"The investigators have already demonstrated the role of targeted heart rate reduction in the management of LVDD in cirrhosis, but the previous study could not demonstrate the role of ivabradine alone in absence of betablocker therapy. This trial will be a validation cohort for the initial data obtained on this novel drug. The use of ivabradine can treat patients who do not tolerate betablocker therapy due to contraindications or adverse effects especially hypotension.\n\nDiagnosis of CCM will be as per 2020 CCMC criteria. CCM is defined as systolic or diastolic dysfunction in the absence of alternative cardiac pathology in concordance with the Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy Consortium (CCMC) criteria. 9 Systolic dysfunction was defined as an ejection fraction (EF) ≤50% or an absolute value of GLS \\<18%. CCM will defined as presence of 3 of the following 4 criteria: septal early diastolic mitral annular flow velocity (e') \\<7 cm/s, early diastolic transmitral flow to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e') ≥15, left atrial volume index (LAVI) \\>34 mL/m2, tricuspid jet maximum velocity \\>2.8 m/s, in the absence of pulmonary hypertension and the presence of measurable early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E/A) ratio (E/A \\>2 = grade 3 \\& E/A 0.8-2 = grade 2 LVDD). Persons meeting only 2 criteria will be termed as indeterminate for LVDD grade."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy","Left Ventricular Dysfunction","Cirrhosis, Liver","Portal Hypertension"],"keywords":["Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy","Left ventricular diatolic dysfunction","Carvedilol","Ivabradine"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"Open Label"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":130,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Carvedilol + Ivabradine","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Betablocker + ivabradine"]},{"label":"Carvedilol","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Betablocker"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Betablocker + ivabradine","description":"Use of maximum tolerated dose of carvedilol and ivabradine to achieve therapeutic heart rate reduction (THR) to 55-65 beats per minute","armGroupLabels":["Carvedilol + Ivabradine"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Betablocker","description":"Use of maximum tolerated dose of carvedilol to achieve targeted heart rate reduction (THR) to 55-65 beats per minute (responder) or inability to reach THR (non responder) with maximum dose of carvedilol, maintaining a minimum MAP of 70 mmHg.","armGroupLabels":["Carvedilol"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survival","description":"All cause mortality to be assessed","timeFrame":"12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in E/e' Ratio","description":"Echo parameter to be documented","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Change in renal function","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Change in HRQoL","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Change in neurohormonal markers- Brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, plasma renin activity","timeFrame":"12 months"},{"measure":"Number of Episodes of Cirrhosis related events","description":"New onset ascites, variceal bleeding,hepatorenal syndrome","timeFrame":"12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age range of 18-65 years\n* Cirrhosis, as diagnosed by histology or clinical, laboratory and USG findings,\n* LV diastolic dysfunction on 2D echocardiography\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Chronic renal disease\n* Patient already on beta blocker\n* Pregnancy and peripartum cardiomyopathy\n* Hypertension\n* Coronary artery disease\n* Valvular heart disease\n* Sick sinus syndrome/ Pacemaker\n* Cardiac rhythm disorder\n* Hypothyroidism\n* Hyperthyroidism\n* Portal vein thrombosis\n* Transjugular intrahepatic porto systemic shunt (TIPS) insertion\n* Hepatocellular carcinoma\n* Anemia Hb \\< 8gm/dl in females, and \\< 9 gm/dl in males","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Madhumita Premkumar, MD DM","role":"CONTACT","phone":"01722756344","email":"drmadhumitap@gmail.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Radha K Dhiman, MD DM","affiliation":"Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh","role":"STUDY_CHAIR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Chandigarh","state":"Choose Any State/Province","zip":"160012","country":"India","contacts":[{"name":"Madhumita Premkumar","role":"CONTACT"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":30.73629,"lon":76.7884}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"31342529","type":"RESULT","citation":"Izzy M, VanWagner LB, Lin G, Altieri M, Findlay JY, Oh JK, Watt KD, Lee SS; Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy Consortium.
