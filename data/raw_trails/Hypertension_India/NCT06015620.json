The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nTo study the correlation between the improving comorbidities associated with obesity after MGB(Mini-Gastric Bypass) surgery and changes in body composition.\n\nOther objectives are:\n\n* Changes in the parameters of the metabolic syndrome after surgery\n* Changes in the cardiovascular risk biomarkers after metabolic surgery\n* Emergence in complications arising out of surgery requiring any intervention or causing a prolonged hospital stay, or requiring additional outpatient visits.\n\nType of Study: An observational study in which participants with morbid obesity will undergo mini-gastric bypass surgery as per routine protocol. No separate experimental interventions will be done in the study for the participants.","detailedDescription":"Evidence supports that bariatric or metabolic surgery is more effective than conventional therapy in controlling obesity and its related comorbidities. Although bariatric surgery has been widely practised for many years worldwide, there is still a need to understand the correlation between improving comorbidities associated with morbid obesity and body composition change post-surgery. Amongst the comorbidities, type II diabetes, sleep apnea, hypertension, and hypothyroidism are the significant ones associated with morbid obesity. A disturbed quality of sleep results in daytime sleepiness, cardiac problems, renal problems, etc., which in turn grossly reduces the work efficiency of an individual and increases morbidity and mortality. From our experience, after a metabolic surgery (mini-gastric bypass -MGB), the investigators find comorbidities, especially sleep apnoea and type II diabetes, getting controlled early before significant weight loss has started. Also, there is an improvement in the parameters of the metabolic syndrome after metabolic surgery. The prospective cohort study aims to correlate the comorbidities resolution after mini-gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity and change in body composition."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Morbid Obesity","Type2diabetes","Sleep Apnea","Hypothyroidism","Hypertension","Lipid Disorder","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","Chronic Venous Hypertension With Ulcer"],"keywords":["morbid obesity","OSA","mini gastric bypass","metabolic surgery","polysomnography","metabolic syndrome","DEXA scan","bioelectrical impedance","body composition"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":35,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with morbid obesity undergoing metabolic surgery (Mini gastric bypass)","description":"The patients undergoing mini gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity and its different comorbidities like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism and chronic venous hypertension.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Mini gastric bypass surgery"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Mini gastric bypass surgery","description":"Mini gastric bypass surgery is a common metabolic or bariatric surgery done world wide for patients suffering from morbid obesity not managed by non surgical modalities of treatment.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with morbid obesity undergoing metabolic surgery (Mini gastric bypass)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To study the correlation between the improving comorbidities associated with obesity after MGB(Mini-Gastric Bypass) surgery and changes in body composition.","description":"The comorbidities associated with obesity like type2 diabetes, sleep apnea, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism and other components of metabolic syndrome improves way ahead after the metabolic surgery as compared to an expected change in the body composition.
