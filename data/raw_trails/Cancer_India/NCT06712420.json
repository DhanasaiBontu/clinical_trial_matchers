Complete surgical excision remains the only potentially curative treatment for early-stage gallbladder cancer.\n\nThe use and benefit of chemotherapy in gallbladder cancer before surgery , that is , in the neoadjuvant setting, is not well studied and, to our knowledge, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been evaluated in any randomized clinical trial.\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy aims to achieve tumor downstaging, increase the radical surgical resection rate, reduce metastases. This study will compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy before surgery in locally advanced gall bladder cancer versus upfront surgery with respect to survival and completeness of resection of disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Gall Bladder Carcinoma"],"keywords":["gallbladder, locally advanced, neoadjuvant"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":114,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"upfront surgery","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"after staging workup and biopsy, patient being taken up for upfront surgical exploration will undergo staging laparoscopy followed by exploration and interaortocaval lymphnode sampling.
