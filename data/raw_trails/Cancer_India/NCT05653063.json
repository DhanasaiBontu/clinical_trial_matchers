The two components include the delineation (outlining) of anatomical areas that are at risk of tumour spread and at risk of radiation damage, and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams.\n\nThe AI-based computer programs have been developed to perform tasks that would normally require direct human involvement by oncologists and medical physicists. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy, which this study will test."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer of Prostate","Cancer Head Neck","Cancer Cervix"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":990,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"A web-based artificial intelligence (AI) auto-planning tool","description":"The CT scan taken at the time of treatment planning is uploaded to a web server called the Radiotherapy planning assistant which automates the contouring of target organs and areas of high-risk disease as well as defining the size, shape and number of radiotherapy beams to treat the cancer.
