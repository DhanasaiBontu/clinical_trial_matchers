Endoscopic resection is recommended for the management of small DNETs measuring ≤10 mm. Various endoscopic techniques have been utilized for the resection of DNETs including endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), band ligation assisted EMR, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However, the published studies report a high rate of histologically incomplete resection even with ESD. More recently, device assisted endoscopic full thickness resection (EFTR) has emerged as a safe and effective resection modality in cases with upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal as well as submucosal lesions. There is limited data on the outcomes of EFTR in cases with DNETs.\n\nIn this study, we aim to compare the rate of histologically complete resection (R0) with ESD and EFTR in cases with DNETs.","detailedDescription":"Primary objective:\n\nRate of R0 resection in both the groups\n\nSecondary outcomes:\n\n1.
