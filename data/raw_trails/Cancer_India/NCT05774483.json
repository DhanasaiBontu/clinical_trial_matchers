The study will compare the outcomes in the two cohorts.","detailedDescription":"Based on the current literature, we know that elective neck dissection (END) is mandatory in clinically node-negative early oral cancers. However, this leads to overtreatment and morbidity in about 55-80% of patients. The emergence of recent level I evidence makes SNB the standard of care in this setting. However, its limitation of being a two-staged procedure, steep learning curve, the burden on resources, lack of infrastructure, short-lasting decrease in morbidity and lack of cost-effectiveness data limits its wide applicability. It is our routine departmental practice of performing limited neck dissection clearing level I-III/IV sparing level IIb which is cleared only if level IIa is metastatic. It is hypothesized that limited END would limit the morbidity of shoulder dysfunction and be a more feasible and cost-effective treatment option which could be a suitable alternative to SNB in this setting without compromising the survival outcomes. With this background, we propose to embark upon a phase III RCT comparing the oncologic outcomes and morbidity of SNB versus limited END. We hypothesize that limited END would have survival outcomes non-inferior, morbidity similar to SNB with higher cost-effectiveness.\n\nAims and objectives:\n\nAim To compare the survival outcomes, morbidity and cost-effectiveness of SNB versus limited END in node-negative early oral cancers\n\nPrimary objective\n\n1) Overall survival\n\nSecondary objectives\n\n1. Shoulder morbidity (key secondary endpoint) longitudinally up to 2 years\n2. Disease-free survival\n3. Neck nodal recurrence-free survival\n4. Other side effects (chyle leak, hematoma, lymphoedema)\n5. Longitudinal Quality of life up to 2 years\n6. Cost-effective analysis\n\nExploratory objectives Blood and tumour tissue will be collected and banked for biomarker studies. Exploratory analyses will be conducted at a later date. Efforts may be directed to identify the biomarkers to predict nodal metastasis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mouth Neoplasms"],"keywords":["mouth neoplasms","neck dissection","sentinel lymph node biopsy","survival","morbidity"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":508,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sentinel node biopsy","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Procedure: Sentinel Node Biopsy"]},{"label":"Limited elective neck dissection","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Procedure: Limited Elective Neck Dissection"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Sentinel Node Biopsy","description":"The Sentinel node will be localized after injecting peritumoral nano colloid followed by dynamic lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT localization.
