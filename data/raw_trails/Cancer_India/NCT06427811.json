The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, Phase IV study is, therefore, to confirm the safety and efficacy of Asciminib in Indian patients with Ph+ CML-CP (without threonine-315 residue with isoleucine \\[T315I\\] mutation), previously treated with 2 or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and patients with Ph+ CML-CP with T315I mutation.","detailedDescription":"This is a Phase IV, prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, post-authorization interventional study to assess the safety and efficacy of asciminib in Indian participants with Ph+ CML-CP (without T315I mutation), previously treated with 2 or more TKIs and participants with Ph+ CML-CP with T315I mutation irrespective of the line of treatment.\n\nThe study will include 3 periods: a screening period (up to 21 days), a treatment period of up to 6 months with asciminib (with dosing according to mutation status), and a safety follow-up period for 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment. Completion of the safety follow-up period after the last dose of the study treatment will be considered as the End of Study (EOS).\n\nAfter obtaining the written informed consent form (ICF) from the participant or their legally authorized representatives (LARs), the participants will undergo screening procedures to confirm their eligibility for the study.\n\nThe results of the breakpoint cluster region gene-Abelson proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase gene (BCR::ABL1) real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) as well as the T315I mutation report need to be established and documented prior to enrollment into the study in the screening period in line with the inclusion criteria of the study. Participants with previously documented T315I mutated CML-CP will be directly considered for the screening procedures. If the status of the T315I mutation is not known, the participant will undergo a standardized Sanger sequencing/PCR/next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based T315I mutation test (as per the availability at the site)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase"],"keywords":["ABL001","Asciminib","Ph+ CML-CP","T315I mutation","Ph+ CML-CP without T315I mutation","Ph+ CML-CP with the T315I mutation","Myelogenous","Chronic","Chronic Myeloid Leukemia","Ph1 Positive Myeloid Leukemia","Philadelphia Positive Myeloid Leukemia","BCR-ABL Positive","Post-authorization Interventional Study","Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors","TKI","Chronic Leukemia","Ph1 Positive Leukemia","Without T315I mutation","with the T315I mutation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":85,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Asciminib","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants without T315I mutation will receive 80 mg once daily at approximately the same time each day OR 40 mg twice daily per Investigator's discretion at approximately 12-hour intervals.\n\nParticipants with T315I mutation will receive200 mg twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals.","interventionNames":["Drug: Asciminib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Asciminib","description":"Film-coated tablets with 40 mg dose strength taken orally","armGroupLabels":["Asciminib"],"otherNames":["ABL001"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency and severity of adverse events(AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs) in participants with Ph+ CML-CP without T315I mutation","description":"Frequency and severity of adverse events(AEs)/serious AEs (SAEs) in participants with Ph+ CML-CP (without T315I mutation), previously treated with 2 or more TKIs up to 6 months","timeFrame":"up to 6 months"},{"measure":"Frequency and severity of AEs/SAEs in participants with Ph+ CML-CP with T315I mutation","description":"Frequency and severity of AEs/SAEs in participants with Ph+ CML-CP with T315I mutation up to 6 months","timeFrame":"up to 6 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of participants with dose interruptions, reductions, and discontinuation (without T3151 mutation)","description":"Percentage of participants with dose interruptions, reductions, and discontinuation up to 6 months.","timeFrame":"up to 6 months"},{"measure":"Percentage of participants achieving a complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 and 6 months (without T3151 mutation)","description":"A CHR is defined as the presence of all of the following for ≥4 weeks: white blood count (WBC) \\<10 x 109/L, platelet count \\<450 x 109/L, basophils \\<5%, no blasts and promyelocytes in peripheral blood, myelocytes + metamyelocytes \\<5% in peripheral blood, no evidence of extramedullary disease, including spleen and liver.","timeFrame":"3 months, 6 months"},{"measure":"Percentage of participants achieving early molecular response (EMR) at 3 and 6 months (without T3151 mutation)","description":"Levels of BCR::ABL1 transcripts will be determined by RQ-PCR testing of peripheral blood and analyzed at a central testing laboratory.
