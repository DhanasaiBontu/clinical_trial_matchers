Seminomas consist of around 50% of cases. However,adequate information is not there as 60- 80% residual disease is seen even after with the standard management of chemotherapy.\n\nWith the advent of functional imaging there was hope that it could aid in more accurately targeting these tumors to systematically evaluate the role of PET-CT imaging in identifying patients diagnosed with stage IIB-IIIC seminomatous germ cell tumor, with residual visible tumor post chemotherapy who would benefit with loco regional radiotherapy.\n\nThe therapeutic research in Seminomashas been relatively slow and such structured studies can allow analysis of large number of patients to report on acute and late effect of treatment outcomes using CTCAE and QOL (EORTC QLQ C-30) in these cancers. We hope that we will get help in identifying thrust areas for future research through this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Seminoma"],"keywords":["FDG-PET CT, radiotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":74,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Radiotherapy","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients randomized to the test arm will undergo radiotherapy to the residual mass.
