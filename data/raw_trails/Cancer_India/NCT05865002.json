The safety and tolerability of oral AUR107 will be evaluated in patients with selected advanced solid tumors (Non-small cell lung cancer, Gastric cancer, Urothelial cancer, Kidney cancer, Colon cancer, and Esophageal cancer) who do not have any available curative or life-prolonging treatment options and have exhausted all effective locally available therapies. The traditional 3+3 design for dose escalation will be used to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and determine the Optimal Biological Dose of AUR107 as a single agent. The Optimal Biological Dose will be selected using a totality of safety, PK, and PD data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Relapsed Malignant Solid Neoplasm"],"keywords":["Relapse malignant neoplasm","Non small cell lung cancer","Gastric cancer","Colon cancer","Esophageal cancer","Kidney cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Dose Escalation \"3+3\" Design","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"AUR107, 5mg to 200mg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Currently, planned dose levels are 5 mg QD, 10 mg QD, 20 mg QD, 40 mg QD, 60 mg QD, 90 mg QD, 135 mg QD, and 200 mg QD","interventionNames":["Drug: AUR107"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"AUR107","description":"Once daily","armGroupLabels":["AUR107, 5mg to 200mg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"First cycle Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT)","description":"Assess dose limiliting toxicities of AUR107","timeFrame":"28 days"},{"measure":"Safety of AUR107 as measured by the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events (AE) graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0","description":"The assessment of safety was based on the frequency of deaths, AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and abnormalities in specific clinical laboratory assessments.
