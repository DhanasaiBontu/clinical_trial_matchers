Chemotherapy has been associated with improved oncological outcomes in various cancers but its role in oral cancer is not well defined in curative setting apart from radio sensitization. Attempted trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy failed to show oncological advantage despite an excellent response rate, in part due to poor patient selection. Patients with a biologically aggressive disease are more likely to benefit, hence we intend to find out the oncological advantage of adding induction chemotherapy to oral squamous cell cancer with advanced nodal disease (N2-N3).\n\nEarlier studies suffered from their heterogeneous patient population- all head and neck subsites together and included a spectrum ranging from early- stage operable cases to inoperable cancer. Due to such patient selection, the intended results were never met. The current study is intended to study the role of chemotherapy in curable patients who are most likely to benefit (biologically aggressive and advanced stage of presentation).\n\nObjective\n\nPrimary:\n\nTo study the 2 year disease free survival by adding induction chemotherapy before surgery in patients of oral cancer with advanced nodal disease as compared to upfront surgery.\n\nSecondary:\n\nTo assess treatment related outcomes between the treatment arms- Response rate; Treatment compliance; treatment related toxicity, postoperative complications and Quality of life.\n\nTo study the overall survival at 2 years. Oral cancer tissue biobanking for future translational research.\n\nStudy population Operable Oral cavity Squamous cell carcinoma with advanced nodal disease (N2-N3) Study Design Open label, Multi centric, randomized controlled trial with allocation ratio of 1:1\n\nSample Size The primary end point is disease-free survival. In order to have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67, using a two-sided significance level, a total of 184 events are needed. Assuming an accrual rate of 15 patients a month, 300 patients need to be recruited. The analysis of DFS will take place 32 months after the start of the trial. The follow-up of patients will continue for 5 years. The analysis of OS will be conducted when 184 deaths are observed. taking 10% of withdrawal of consent, a total of 346 patients need to be included.\n\nInclusion Criteria Biopsy proven, operable oral Squamous cell carcinoma cT1-T4; cN2-N3, with adequate organ function, Age- 18-75 years, ECOG-PS:0-2 Treatment Arms\n\nStandard Arm (SURG arm):\n\nSurgery (Wide local Excision/composite resection with neck dissection) followed by adjuvant Radiotherapy ± Concurrent Chemotherapy\n\nExperimental Arm (ICT):\n\n2# TPF or TPX based induction chemotherapy followed by Surgery (Wide local Excision/composite resection with neck dissection) followed by adjuvant Radiotherapy ± Concurrent Chemotherapy\n\nStudy endpoints Primary- Disease free survival Secondary- Overall survival/ Quality of life/ Toxicity of treatment/ Treatment tolerance"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Oral Cancer","Head and Neck Neoplasms"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":346,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Surg Arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Wide Local Excision (WLE) with Comprehensive neck dissection Adjuvant Treatment as per current standard Guidelines","interventionNames":["Combination Product: Surgery and Adjuvant Treatment"]},{"label":"ICT Arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"2# of Chemotherapy before the Stadrard Surery: Either TPF or TPX Wide Local Excision (WLE) with Comprehensive neck dissection Adjuvant Treatment as per current standard Guidelines","interventionNames":["Combination Product: TPF or TPX Regimen (2# ICT) --> Surgery and Adjuvant Treatment"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"COMBINATION_PRODUCT","name":"TPF or TPX Regimen (2# ICT) --> Surgery and Adjuvant Treatment","description":"TPF:\n\nIINJ DOCETAXEL 75mg/M2 in 500 ML NORMAL SALINE(PVC free container/glass bottle) via codon filter OVER 60 MIN (DAY 1 ONLY) INJ.
