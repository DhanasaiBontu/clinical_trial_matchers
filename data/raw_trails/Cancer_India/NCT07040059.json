In Phase 1b, patients diagnosed with advanced HER2 positive gastric/gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in a 3 + 3 design dose escalation manner to evaluate the safety, efficacy, PK/PD of AUR103 Calcium when administered in combination with Trastuzumab and CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin). Phase 2 is a randomization study. The primary objective of the phase 2 study is to assess the efficacy of AUR103 Calcium when administered in combination with Trastuzumab and CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin).

In the study part 1 (Phase 1b), there will 3 cohorts; Cohort 1 patients will receive the study drug (AUR103 Calcium) at 200 mg BID dose along with standard doses of trastuzumab, and CAPOX (capecitabie and oxaliplatin), Cohort 2 patients will receive the study drug (AUR103 Calcium) at 300 mg BID dose along with standard doses of trastuzumab, and CAPOX, and Cohort 3 patients will receive the study drug (AUR103 Calcium) at 400 mg BID dose along with standard doses of trastuzumab, and CAPOX.\n\nIn the study Part 2 (Phase 2), the efficacy of AUR103 calcium in combination with Trastuzumab and CAPOX will be evaluated in HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients. The part 2 (Phase 2) of the study will be a randomized study which will start after part 1 (Phase 1b). In the study part 2 (Phase 2), there will either 1 or 2 treatment arm(s) and one control arm (Trastuzumab + CAPOX). The number treatment arms will be based on the phase 1b data.
