An amended protocol extended the eligibility criteria of patients recruited to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort, to include colorectal cancer (CRC) and GE carcinomas.\n\nFollowing the Dose Escalation part, antibodies binding to NAP have been shown to interfere with drug exposure, which makes it unlikely that patients could effectively receive more than 3 cycles of NAP. Obinutuzumab pretreatment was added to the combination of durvalumab and NAP given at the 2 highest safe dose levels of the combination of durvalumab and NAP in the dose-escalation part of this Phase 1b study (3 patients per dose level), and to the MTD expansion part that included several cohorts.\n\nThe combination of NAP/durvalumab combination will be further evaluated at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) established in the dose- escalation part, (10 µg/kg/dose), in an expansion cohort of subjects with advanced/metastatic carcinoma of the esophagus."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["ER+ Breast Cancer","Ovarian Cancer","Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma","Endometrial Cancer","Renal Cell Carcinoma","Urothelial Cancer","Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma","Mesothelioma","Melanoma","Hepatocellular Carcinoma","Prostate Cancer","NSCLC","HER2-negative Breast Cancer","Triple Negative Breast Cancer","Bladder Cancer","Colorectal Cancer Metastatic","GastroEsophageal Cancer","NSCL2 Gene Mutation","Esophageal Cancer"],"keywords":["Esophageal cancer","Squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus","Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":120,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dose Escalation naptumomab estafenatox 2 µg/kg and durvalumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"NAP was administered on the first four days of each 21-day cycle, at daily doses of 2 µg/kg.
