Patients with no signs and symptoms of neuropathy will be recruited for the study. They will be followed up during the course of treatment and will undergo complete neurological examination by Total neuropathy score clinical version and nerve conduction velocity test will be done at 4th cycle to detect CIPN. Severity of CIPN will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.\n\nB)Estimation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D and Homocysteine level in all groups at baseline \\& 4th cycle 10,16 Approximately five millilitre of peripheral venous blood will be collected from each patient in anticoagulant (Acid-citrate-dextrose A) and centrifuge at 2500 RPM for 5 minutes.
