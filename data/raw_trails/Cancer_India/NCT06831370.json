Another aim is to learn how well treatment of brentuximab vedotin plus AVD works.\n\nAll participants will receive brentuximab vedotin plus AVD for approximately 6 months. Participants will undergo tests like Echocardiography (ECHO) and pulmonary function testing (PFT) during the study. ECHO is a test that uses ultrasound to show how the heart muscle and valves are working; PFT is a test to check how well a participant's lungs work.\n\nEach participant will undergo a final health status check 2 months after the last treatment with brentuximab vedotin plus AVD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hodgkin Lymphoma"],"keywords":["Lymphoma","Chemotherapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":124,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Brentuximab Vedotin 1.2 mg/kg","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive 1.2 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) brentuximab vedotin intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle, within 1 hour after completion of treatment with other agents \\[25 milligrams per meter square (mg/m\\^2) doxorubicin, 6 mg/m\\^2 vinblastine and 375 mg/m\\^2 dacarbazine IV infusions\\] for a maximum of 6 cycles.","interventionNames":["Drug: Brentuximab Vedotin","Drug: Doxorubicin","Drug: Vinblastine","Drug: Dacarbazine"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Brentuximab Vedotin","description":"Brentuximab Vedotin IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Brentuximab Vedotin 1.2 mg/kg"],"otherNames":["Adcetris"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Doxorubicin","description":"Doxorubicin IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Brentuximab Vedotin 1.2 mg/kg"],"otherNames":["Adriamycin"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vinblastine","description":"Vinblastine IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Brentuximab Vedotin 1.2 mg/kg"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Dacarbazine","description":"Dacarbazine IV infusion","armGroupLabels":["Brentuximab Vedotin 1.2 mg/kg"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), and Unexpected ADRs","description":"An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment.

An SAE is any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.
