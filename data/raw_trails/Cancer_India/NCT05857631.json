Treatment will be delivered with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) under image guidance. Patients for whom concurrent chemotherapy is indicated (as per adverse risk features) will receive concurrent weekly cisplatin (40mg/m2) based on standard institutional protocol. All patients with post-operative cervical cancer will receive vaginal brachytherapy after the completion of external beam radiation. Patients with endometrial cancer with certain pre defined risk factors will also receive vaginal brachytherapy. The dose of vaginal brachytherapy will be 6 Gy high dose rate brachytherapy delivered as two different fractions, one week apart. Patients will be evaluated by the concerned investigators on a weekly basis during radiation therapy and all the toxicities will be documented according to the CTCAE V 5.0.\n\nPatients will be followed up 3 monthly for the first 2 years, then 6 monthly from years 2 - 5, and annually thereafter. CTCAE version 5 will be used for toxicity grading at each follow-up. Quality of life assessment will be performed at baseline prior to the start of radiation and on follow-up at pre-specified times using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and Cervix - 24 (CX24) for cervical cancer patients and Endometrium 24 (EN24) for endometrial cancer patients."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Cancer","Endometrial Cancer"],"keywords":["Hypofractionated Radiation","Radiotherapy, Adjuvant","Radiotherapy, Intensity modulated","Late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Single-arm, open-label phase II trial investigating the cumulative incidence of late grade ≥2 gastro-intestinal or genito-urinary toxicities in patients receiving adjuvant hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis for post-operative cervical or endometrial cancer.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":90,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Hypofractionated Image guided External Beam Radiation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Adjuvant hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy for post operative patients with cervical or endometrial cancer.","interventionNames":["Radiation: Hypofractionated Image guided External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)","Drug: Cisplatin","Radiation: Vaginal brachytherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Hypofractionated Image guided External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)","description":"External beam radiotherapy to pelvis:\n\nPost operative hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy with intensity modulated/arc technique, to a dose of 39 Gy in 13 fractions, at 3 Gy per fraction, delivered once daily, 5 days a week, over 2.5-3 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Hypofractionated Image guided External Beam Radiation"],"otherNames":["Radiotherapy"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cisplatin","description":"Patients who require adjuvant chemotherapy along with radiation, based on predefined risk features, will receive 5 cycles of cisplatin on a weekly basis with a dose of 40 mg/m2 by IV infusion over a period of 1 hour 2-4 hours prior to start of EBRT.","armGroupLabels":["Hypofractionated Image guided External Beam Radiation"],"otherNames":["Chemotherapy"]},{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Vaginal brachytherapy","description":"Vaginal brachytherapy, two fractions of 6 Gy each, delivered 1 week apart.","armGroupLabels":["Hypofractionated Image guided External Beam Radiation"],"otherNames":["Brachytherapy"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"3-year cumulative incidence of grade ≥2 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity","description":"To evaluate the 3-year cumulative incidence of late grade ≥2 gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity using CTCAE version 5 scoring receiving radiation with hypo fractionation.","timeFrame":"Median follow up of 3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pelvic Control Rate at 3 years","description":"To report 3 year pelvic control rate (local and pelvic nodal) in patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy.","timeFrame":"Median follow up of 3 years"},{"measure":"Disease Free Survival at 3 years","description":"To report 3 year disease free survival in patients receiving hypo fractionated radiotherapy.","timeFrame":"Median follow up of 3 years"},{"measure":"Overall Survival at 3 years","description":"To report 3 year overall survival in patients receiving hypo fractionated radiotherapy.","timeFrame":"Median follow up of 3 years"},{"measure":"Acute Toxicities Evaluation","description":"Acute toxicity will be reported using CTCAE V. 5.0","timeFrame":"3 months"},{"measure":"Assessment of Quality of Life for cervical cancer patients","description":"To assess quality of life in using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CX24.
