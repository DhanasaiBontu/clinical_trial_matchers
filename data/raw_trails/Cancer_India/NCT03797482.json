To study this, clinical samples (Tumor biopsies) will be obtained during the surgery after partial devascularisation (sample B) and stored for future genomic and proteonomic evaluations.","detailedDescription":"Three tumor samples will be obtained after the patient is under anaesthesia,\n\n1. Prior to starting surgery (Sample A)\n2. The middle intra-operative sample, which will be collected when half the tumour has been devascularized (i.e., somewhere midway during the surgery). (Sample B)\n3. A third post excision (anoxic sample C). These tumour tissue samples will be stored as snap frozen, in RNA later and as paraffin sections.\n\nTo understand the effects induced by acute hypoxia that sets in during surgery in breast cancer.

Protein levels will be quantitated, and their levels evaluated, during different time-points of surgical resection.
