The reduced duration will be intensified with addition of newer hormonal agents such as abiraterone or enzalutamide tablets, which have been shown to improve disease control in locally advanced prostate cancer. This is hoped to reduce the side effects of prolonged hormone therapy, while maintaining similar rates of disease control and survival.\n\nThe effectiveness of both treatment approaches will be assessed in terms of cancer control, survival, and overall quality of life of patients. Additionally, the study will examine the side effects associated with each treatment regimen, which could provide valuable insights into impact of treatment duration on patients. If a person decides not to participate, they will still receive the standard two years of hormonal therapy and radiation therapy outside the study. This ensures that all patients receive appropriate care regardless of their involvement in the research. Participation is voluntary, and will not affect patient care."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Carcinoma"],"keywords":["Prostate Cancer","Prostate Radiotherapy","Hormone
