Each of these drugs have with their own set of advantages and also side effects. An ideal common system of analgesia is not possible due to patient variability. And no drug is devoid of side effects. Hence the aim is to ensure effective analgesia using drugs or techniques which are minimally invasive with negligible side effects.","detailedDescription":"Efficient post operative pain relief is an essential part of comprehensive recovery of patients. Conventional method of pain management of laparotomy surgeries in CA endometrium and cervix patients involves invasive techniques like epidural or selective nerve block coupled with a varied choice of analgesics like opioids, NSAID or acetaminophen, wherein each drug is associated with its own set of contraindications and side effects. Despite advances in analgesic regimen including multimodal analgesic regimen, opioids have been observed to remain the mainstay postoperative analgesia in cancer patients despite its well-established side effects.\n\nThis double-blinded prospective interventional study is conducted to explore the alternative of percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS) devices for effective pain relief with minimal to no side-effects.\n\nThe device will have tiny needles and a battery system that will be placed on and behind the patient's ear when they are under anesthesia.\n\nIt acts by stimulating nerves around ear region by series of pain free impulse generation leading to centrally (brain) mediated response by altering certain chemical substances responsible for causing pain thereby providing relief for the patient."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cancer of Endometrium","Cancer of Cervix"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"DOUBLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment Group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The group who have received PENS treatment using PrimaryRelief in addition to Injection paracetamol in a dosage of 15mg/kg every 6th hourly.
