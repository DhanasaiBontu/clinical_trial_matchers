The safety and tolerability of oral AUR108 will be evaluated in patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma who do not have any available curative or life-prolonging treatment options and have exhausted all effective locally available therapies. The traditional 3+3 design for dose escalation will be used to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and determine the Optimal Biological Dose of AUR108 as a single agent.
