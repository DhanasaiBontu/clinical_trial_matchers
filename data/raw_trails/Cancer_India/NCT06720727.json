Standard treatment includes definitive radiation therapy to primary site along with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy following histological confirmation with a biopsy. Studies have shown poorer outcomes in the paediatric age group compared to that of adults and an increased risk to fail/recur in the leptomeninges(covering of brain and spinal cord). The following study is planned in order to assess the benefit of craniospinal irradiation(delivering radiotherapy to brain, spinal cord and its covering membrane in this high risk population. Thereby the investigator aim to improve survival in newly diagnosed histone mutant pediatric midline gliomas in the upfront setting. Patterns of disease failure, treatment related toxicities and quality of life will also be assessed as a part of this study. If proven beneficial, this study will influence how patients with this diagnosis will be treated in the future.","detailedDescription":"Introduction: Paediatric H3K27/H3G34 mutant diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive high-grade gliomas predominantly affecting midline structures and cerebral hemispheres. Despite aggressive therapy including radiation and chemotherapy, these tumors carry a poor prognosis, particularly in children, with frequent recurrence and high risk of leptomeningeal spread. Current standard treatment involves definitive radiation therapy to the primary site and concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy following histological confirmation via biopsy. However, outcomes remain suboptimal, prompting exploration of more intensive therapeutic strategies.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo study if the addition of craniospinal irradiation to standard practice improves outcomes in pediatric diffuse midline glioma.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* Estimate median time to leptomeningeal dissemination and compare with historical control\n* Study patterns of failure\n* Early and late toxicities\n* Study quality of life indices\n* To estimate QTWiST (Quality of life without symptoms or toxicity)\n\nPrimary endpoint: Overall survival at 12 months\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Time to leptomeningeal dissemination in months\n* Incidence of different failure patterns from clinico-radiological assessment\n* Toxicity assessment with the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v5) during CSI(weekly), at conclusion of radiotherapy , post completion of 6 cycles adjuvant temozolomide, and in subsequent follow-ups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.\n* Quality of life indices using the EORTC QLQC- 30 and its BN -20 module at baseline, after completion of radiotherapy, post completion of 6 cycles adjuvant temozolomide and in subsequent follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.\n* Quality of life without symptoms or toxicity in three health states TOX (toxicity), TWIST (time without symptoms) and REL (relapse) at baseline, after completion of radiotherapy, post completion of 6 cycles adjuvant temozolomide and in subsequent follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.\n\nStudy setting: The study will be conducted in the department of Radiation Oncology, Neuro Oncology Disease management group"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Glioma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":32,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Single arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Craniospinal irradiation involves delivery of radiation therapy to the whole brain, spinal cord, nerve roots, the covering meninges(leptomeninges) and subarachnoid space and provides a viable means of mitigating leptomeningeal spread and possibly improving survival.","interventionNames":["Radiation: craniospinal irradiation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"craniospinal irradiation","description":"Delivering radiotherapy to brain, spinal cord and its covering membrane.","armGroupLabels":["Single arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Survival Outcomes","description":"Overall survival- time in months between the date of diagnosis to date of death due to any cause","timeFrame":"at 12 months"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Leptomeningeal Dissemination","description":"Time to leptomeningeal dissemination (will be defined as time in months between completion of planned therapy to the date of confirmation of leptomeningeal metastasis)","timeFrame":"at 12 months"},{"measure":"Patterns of failure","description":"Incidence of different patterns of failure from diagnosis ( the time point of measurement of the primary outcome - overall survival","timeFrame":"at 12 months"},{"measure":"Any treatment emergent acute toxicity recording","description":"All treatment emergent acute toxicity- expected (nausea, vomiting, hematological, dermatitis and mucositis) and unexpected, will be recorded.\n\nGrading will be done for all using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5","timeFrame":"Baseline , week 1 , week 2 , week 3 , week 4 , week 5 ,week 6 , conclusion of RT"},{"measure":"Quality of life indices","description":"Objective scoring with European Organisation For Research And Treatment Of Cancer(EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire(QLQC-30), brain specific module (BN 20)","timeFrame":"will be done at 3 months"},{"measure":"QTWiST (Quality of life Without Symptoms or Toxicity) calculation","description":"Objective score calculation using mean duration in each health state weighed by a utility coefficient; from QLQC 30- BN 20 scores and the time spent in serious toxicity and without relapse.","timeFrame":"will be done at 3 months"},{"measure":"Any treatment emergent late toxicity recording","description":"All treatment emergent late toxicity- expected and unexpected, will be recorded after completion of chemotherapy.
