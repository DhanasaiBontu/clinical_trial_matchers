Implementing mammography screening is complex and resource-intensive, making it impractical in resource-limited settings. Clinical breast examination (CBE) has been recommended as an alternative screening option for low- and middle-income countries. Several studies have shown a significant shift towards earlier stage tumours detected by CBE. However, the high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value of CBE expose women to unnecessary and costly further diagnostic procedures, as well as the negative psychological consequences. There is an urgent need for a more accurate, cost-effective and reliable triage technology that can be performed by any healthcare provider."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer","Carcinoma in Situ"],"keywords":["Breast cancer","Screening","Low- and middle-income countries","Clinical breast examination","Portable ultrasound device","Triage"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"This is a single-arm study in which women with a positive clinical breast examination will be triaged using a portable ultrasound device by non-radiologists.
