The study will be registry-based to allow simpler and more comprehensive follow-up. Patients with colorectal cancer will be treated with cytoreductive surgery (CRS) together with either standard oxaliplatin HIPEC (the control for the efficacy study) or oxaliplatin/irinotecan HIPEC in combination with 5-FU 24-hour EPIC. The 5-FU will be administered postoperatively when the abdomen is completely sutured. The drug is divided equally into 2 injections of 200 ml each and injected through two abdominal drains that are clamped for 16 hours.\n\nFor dose escalation, the titration groups (á 3 or 6 patients) are followed for 30 days postoperatively after which the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will determine whether or not to increase the 5-FU dose for the following group of patients.\n\nTo study efficacy, randomization is performed intraoperatively. The patient is followed up postoperatively for a total of 3 years for the secondary endpoints which may be extended by the study committee to 5 years. Since the trial is registry based, the long-term follow-up does not require separate eCRF evaluations. These evaluations can be automatically retrieved from the registry - both recurrence data, quality of life, and morbidity data. Some specific eCRF evaluations will be integrated as a separate study part of the HIPEC registry, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria and adverse event reporting (including SUSAR reporting).","detailedDescription":"Not detailed description entered."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Colorectal Cancer","Peritoneal Metastases"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":213,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Standard HIPEC","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Injection of oxaliplatin 460 mg/m2 and an intraoperational IV of 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2, and calcium folinate 60 mg/m2.","interventionNames":["Drug: Oxaliplatin"]},{"label":"Intensified HIPEC+EPIC","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Injection of irinotecan 360 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 24-hr EPIC 250-850 mg/m2 in combination with Oxaliplatin 360 mg/m2 and an intraoperational IV of 5-fluorouracil bolus 400 mg/m2 with calcium folinate 60mg/m2.\n\nThe EPIC treatment is given after the abdomen is completely sutured in the operating theater.
