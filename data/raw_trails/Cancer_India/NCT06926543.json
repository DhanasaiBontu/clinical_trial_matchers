It seeks to answer the following key questions:\n\n1. When compared to sequential treatment, does concurrent chemoradiotherapy increase disease-free survival?\n2. What effects does concurrent treatment have on post-operative look, quality of life, and side effects including arm swelling (lymphoedema)?\n3. What are each treatment approach's financial costs?\n\nResearchers will compare the following to groups:\n\nArm A: Participants in the sequential treatment group will first undergo chemotherapy and then radiation.\n\nand Arm B: Participants in the concurrent treatment group will undergo radiation therapy while undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nParticipants are going to:\n\n1. Get the usual chemotherapy (taxanes and/or anthracyclines).\n2. Receive radiation therapy for three to four weeks.\n3. Have follow-up visits every 6months for 5years to check for cancer recurrence, side effects, and quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Invasive Breast Cancer","Stage III Breast Cancer","Stage IIB Breast Cancer"],"keywords":["Invasive breast cancer","Chemoradiation","Sequential","Concurrent","adjuvant therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":858,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm A: Standard Arm","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants randomized to arm A arm will receive sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy","interventionNames":["Drug: Chemoradiation"]},{"label":"Arm B: Experimental arm","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants randomized to arm B will receive concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy","interventionNames":["Drug: Chemoradiation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chemoradiation","description":"This intervention will consist of getting chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, i.e, in a sequential manner","armGroupLabels":["Arm A: Standard Arm"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Chemoradiation","description":"This intervention will consist of getting chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the same time, i.e, in a concurrent manner.","armGroupLabels":["Arm B: Experimental arm"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Study the 3-year Disease Free Survival.","timeFrame":"From enrollment to 3 years after treatment at six months intervals."}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Impact of concurrent regimen on patient's Quality of life using the EORTC QLQ 30 and BR 23 and EQ5D5L questionnaire.","timeFrame":"From enrollment at pre-raditherapy, post-radiotherapy completion and on follow up at 12-monthly interval up to 3 years."},{"measure":"Subjective and objective assessment of cosmesis in breast-conserving surgery patients, utilizing the Harvard scale and the BCCT core photographic evaluation, respectively.","description":"All patients who undergo breast conservation surgery will be eligible for this sub-study in which we intend to collect frontal breast photographs for objective assessment of breast cosmesis.","timeFrame":"From enrollment at pre-raditherapy, post-radiotherapy completion and on follow up at 12-monthly interval up to 3 years."},{"measure":"The difference in direct and indirect cost of treatment in the two arms will be assessed using the FACT-COST.","description":"As patients in the intervention arm will complete their treatment at least 6-8 weeks before the patients in the standard arm, it will have huge impact on the expenditure that the patient bears for staying, food as well as transport to the hospital.
